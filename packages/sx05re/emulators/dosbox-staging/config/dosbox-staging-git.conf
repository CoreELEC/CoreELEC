#          display: Number of display to use; values depend on OS and user settings.
#   fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: 'original', 'desktop'
#                   or a fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
# windowresolution: Set window size to be used when running in windowed mode:
#                     default:   Select the best option based on your
#                                environment and other settings.
#                     original:  Resize window to the resolution picked by
#                                the emulated program.
#                     resizable: Make the emulator window resizable.
#                                This is an experimental option, works only with

#                     <custom>:  Scale the window content to the indicated
#                                dimensions, in WxH format. For example: 1024x768.
#                                Scaling is not performed for output=surface.
#           output: What video system to use for output.
#                   Possible values: surface, texture, texturenb, texturepp.
# texture_renderer: Choose a renderer driver when using a texture output mode.

#                   Possible values: auto, opengles2, software.
#    capture_mouse: Choose a mouse control method:
#                      onclick:        The mouse will be captured after the first
#                                      click inside the window.
#                      onstart:        The mouse is captured immediately on start
#                                      (similar to real DOS).
#                      seamless:       The mouse can move seamlessly in and out of DOSBox
#                                      window and cannot be captured.
#                      nomouse:        The mouse is disabled and hidden without any
#                                      input sent to the game.
#                   Choose how middle-clicks are handled (second parameter):
#                      middlegame:     Middle-clicks are sent to the game
#                                      (Ctrl-F10 uncaptures the mouse).
#                      middlerelease:  Middle-clicks are used to uncapture the mouse
#                                      (not sent to the game). However, middle-clicks
#                                      will be sent to the game in fullscreen or when
#                                      seamless control is set.
#                                      Ctrl-F10 will also uncapture the mouse.
#                   Defaults (if not present or incorrect): seamless middlerelease
#                   Possible values: seamless, onclick, onstart, nomouse.
#      sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity. The optional second parameter specifies vertical sensitivity (e.g. 100,-50).
#  raw_mouse_input: Enable this setting to bypass your operating system's mouse
#                   acceleration and sensitivity settings. This works in
#                   fullscreen or when the mouse is captured in window mode.
#      waitonerror: Wait before closing the console if dosbox has an error.
#         priority: Priority levels for dosbox. Second entry behind the comma is for when dosbox is not focused/minimized.
#                   pause is only valid for the second entry.
#                   Possible values: lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest, pause.
#       mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from.
#                   Resetmapper only works with the default value.
#      screensaver: Use 'allow' or 'block' to override the SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER
#                   environment variable (which usually blocks the OS screensaver
#                   while the emulator is running).

# monochrome_palette: Select default palette for monochrome display.
#                     Works only when emulating hercules or cga_mono.
#                     You can also cycle through available colours using F11.

#                     the result might not be desired.
#                     Note that some scalers may use black borders to fit the image

#    cycles: Amount of instructions DOSBox tries to emulate each millisecond.
#            Setting this value too high results in sound dropouts and lags.
#            Cycles can be set in 3 ways:
#              'auto'          tries to guess what a game needs.
#                              It usually works, but can fail for certain games.
#              'fixed #number' will set a fixed amount of cycles. This is what you usually
#                              need if 'auto' fails (Example: fixed 4000).
#              'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to
#                              handle.
#            Possible values: auto, fixed, max.

#               the dedicated [fluidsynth] section below.
#             - When using ALSA, use Linux command 'aconnect -l' to list open
#               MIDI ports, and select one (for example 'midiconfig=14:0'
#               for sequencer client 14, port 0).
#             - When using a Roland MT-32 rev.0 as midi output device, some
#               games may require a delay in order to prevent MT-32 hardware
#               buffer overflow issues. In that case, add 'delaysysex',
