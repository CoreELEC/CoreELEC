#          fullscreen: Start directly in fullscreen.
#                      Run INTRO and see Special Keys for window control hotkeys.
#             display: Number of display to use; values depend on OS and user settings.
#      fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: 'original', 'desktop'
#                      or a fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
#    windowresolution: Set window size when running in windowed mode:
#                        default:   Select the best option based on your
#                                   environment and other settings.
#                        small, medium, or large (or s, m, l):
#                                   Size the window relative to the desktop.
#                        <custom>:  Scale the window to the given dimensions in
#                                   WxH format. For example: 1024x768.
#                                   Scaling is not performed for output=surface.
# viewport_resolution: Set the viewport size (drawable area) within the window/screen:
#                        fit:       Fit the viewport to the available window/screen (default).
#                        <custom>:  Limit the viewport within to a custom resolution or percentage of
#                                   the desktop. Specified in WxH, N%, N.M%. Examples: 960x720 or 50%
#     window_position: Set initial window position when running in windowed mode:
#                        auto:      Let the window manager decide the position.
#                        <custom>:  Set window position in X,Y format. For example: 250,100
#                                   0,0 is the top-left corner of the screen.
#  window_decorations: Controls whether to display window decorations in windowed mode.
#        transparency: Set the transparency of the DOSBox Staging screen.
#                      From 0 (no transparency) to 90 (high transparency).
#           host_rate: Set the host's refresh rate:
#                        auto:      Use SDI rates, or VRR rates when fullscreen on a high-refresh display.
#                        sdi:       Use serial device interface (SDI) rates, without further adjustment.
#                        vrr:       Deduct 3 Hz from the reported rate (best-practice for VRR displays).
#                        <custom>:  Specify a custom rate as a whole or decimal value greater than 23.000.
#               vsync: Synchronize with display refresh rate if supported. This can
#                      reduce flickering and tearing, but may also impact performance.
#          vsync_skip: Number of microseconds to allow rendering to block before skipping the next frame. 0 disables this and will always render.
#   presentation_mode: Optionally select the frame presentation mode:
#                        auto:  Intelligently time and drop frames to prevent
#                               emulation stalls, based on host and DOS frame rates.
#                        cfr:   Always present DOS frames at a constant frame rate.
#                        vfr:   Always present changed DOS frames at a variable frame rate.

#                      Possible values: surface, texture, texturenb, texturepp.
#    texture_renderer: Choose a renderer driver when using a texture output mode.
#                      Use texture_renderer=auto for an automatic choice.
#                      Possible values: auto, opengles2, software.
#       capture_mouse: Choose a mouse control method:
#                         onclick:        Capture the mouse when clicking any button in the window.
#                         onstart:        Capture the mouse immediately on start.
#                         seamless:       Let the mouse move seamlessly; captures only with middle-click or hotkey.
#                         nomouse:        Hide the mouse and don't send input to the game.
#                      Choose how middle-clicks are handled (second parameter):
#                         middlegame:     Middle-clicks are sent to the game.
#                         middlerelease:  Middle-click will release the captured mouse, and also capture when seamless.
#                      Defaults (if not present or incorrect): seamless middlerelease
#                      Possible values: seamless, onclick, onstart, nomouse.
#         sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity. The optional second parameter specifies vertical sensitivity (e.g. 100,-50).
#     raw_mouse_input: Enable this setting to bypass your operating system's mouse
#                      acceleration and sensitivity settings. This works in
#                      fullscreen or when the mouse is captured in window mode.
#         waitonerror: Wait before closing the console if dosbox has an error.
#            priority: Priority levels for dosbox. Second entry behind the comma is for when dosbox is not focused/minimized.
#                      pause is only valid for the second entry. auto disables priority levels and uses OS defaults
#                      Possible values: auto, lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest, pause.
#          mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from.
#                      Resetmapper only works with the default value.
#         screensaver: Use 'allow' or 'block' to override the SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER
#                      environment variable (which usually blocks the OS screensaver
#                      while the emulator is running).
#                      Possible values: auto, allow, block.

#                           The 'resources/translations' directory bundled with the executable holds
#                           these files. Please keep it along-side the executable to support this feature.
#           machine: The type of machine DOSBox tries to emulate.

#           memsize: Amount of memory DOSBox has in megabytes.
#                    This value is best left at its default to avoid problems with some games,
#                    though few games might require a higher value.
#                    There is generally no speed advantage when raising this value.
#          vmemsize: Video memory in MiB (1-8) or KiB (256 to 8192). 'auto' uses the default per video adapter.
#                    Possible values: auto, 1, 2, 4, 8, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192.
#          dos_rate: Customize the emulated video mode's frame rate, in Hz:
#                    default:  The DOS video mode determines the rate (recommended).
#                    host:     Match the DOS rate to the host rate (see 'host_rate' setting).
#                    <value>:  Sets the rate to an exact value, between 24.000 and 1000.000 (Hz).
#                    We recommend the 'default' rate; otherwise test and set on a per-game basis.

#                                   This is recommended along with 4 or 8 MB of video memory.
#                      all          Offers all modes for a given video memory size, however
#                                   some games may not use them properly (flickering) or may need
#                                   more system memory (mem = ) to use them.
#                    Possible values: compatible, all.
#        speed_mods: Permit changes known to improve performance. Currently no games are known
#                    to be affected by this. Please file a bug with the project if you find a
#                    game that fails when this is set to true so we will list them here.
#  autoexec_section: How autoexec sections are handled from multiple config files.
#                    join      : combines them into one big section (legacy behavior).
#                    overwrite : use the last one encountered, like other conf settings.
#                    Possible values: join, overwrite.
# startup_verbosity: Controls verbosity prior to displaying the program:
#                    Verbosity   | Splash | Welcome | Early stdout

# monochrome_palette: Select default palette for monochrome display.
#                     Works only when emulating hercules or cga_mono.
#                     You can also cycle through available colours using F11.
#                     Possible values: white, paperwhite, green, amber.
#             scaler: Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes.
#                     If 'forced' is appended, then the scaler will be used even if
#                     the result might not be desired.
#                     Note that some scalers may use black borders to fit the image

#              'auto'          tries to guess what a game needs.
#                              It usually works, but can fail for certain games.
#              'fixed #number' will set a fixed number of cycles. This is what you usually
#                              need if 'auto' fails (Example: fixed 4000).
#              'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to
#                              handle.
#            Possible values: auto, fixed, max.
#   cycleup: Number of cycles added or subtracted with speed control hotkeys.

#             Possible values: auto, oss, alsa, fluidsynth, mt32, none.
# midiconfig: Configuration options for the selected MIDI interface.
#             This is usually the id or name of the MIDI synthesizer you want
#             to use (find the id/name with DOS command 'mixer /listmidi').
#             - This option has no effect when using the built-in synthesizers
#               (mididevice = fluidsynth or mt32).
#             - When using ALSA, use Linux command 'aconnect -l' to list open
#               MIDI ports, and select one (for example 'midiconfig=14:0'
#               for sequencer client 14, port 0).
#             - If you're using a physical Roland MT-32 with revision 0 PCB,
#               the hardware may require a delay in order to prevent its
#               buffer from overflowing. In that case, add 'delaysysex',
#               for example: 'midiconfig=2 delaysysex'.
#             See the README/Manual for more details.

#            An optional percentage will scale the SoundFont's volume.
#            For example: 'soundfont.sf2 50' will attenuate it by 50 percent.
#            The scaling percentage can range from 1 to 500.

#                    Note: Inside DOS, setting this up requires an NE2000 packet driver,
#                          DHCP client, and TCP/IP stack. You might need port-forwarding
#                          from the host into the DOS guest, and from your router to your
#                          host when acting as the server for multiplayer games.
#           nicbase: The base address of the NE2000 card.
#                    Note: Addresses 220 and 240 might not be available as they're assigned

#           macaddr: The MAC address of the NE2000 card.
# tcp_port_forwards: Forwards one or more TCP ports from the host into the DOS guest.
#                    The format is:
#                      port1  port2  port3 ... (e.g., 21 80 443)
#                      This will forward FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS into the DOS guest.
#                    If the ports are privileged on the host, a mapping can be used
#                      host:guest  ..., (e.g., 8021:21 8080:80)
#                      This will forward ports 8021 and 8080 to FTP and HTTP in the guest
#                    A range of adjacent ports can be abbreviated with a dash:
#                      start-end ... (e.g., 27910-27960)
#                      This will forward ports 27910 to 27960 into the DOS guest.
#                    Mappings and ranges can be combined, too:
#                      hstart-hend:gstart-gend ..., (e.g, 8040-8080:20-60)
#                      This forwards ports 8040 to 8080 into 20 to 60 in the guest
#                    Notes:
#                      - If mapped ranges differ, the shorter range is extended to fit.
#                      - If conflicting host ports are given, only the first one is setup.
#                      - If conflicting guest ports are given, the latter rule takes precedent.
# udp_port_forwards: Forwards one or more UDP ports from the host into the DOS guest.
#                    The format is the same as for TCP port forwards.
