Subject: [PATCH] tls: libwidevinecdm.so: since 4.10.2252.0 has TLS with
 64-byte alignment Change the max_align to 64U instead 16 to make it possible
 to use dlopen again. Tests by changing TLS_TCB_ALIGN directly showed up some
 random crashes. Reverence: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/7/3/754 Modify
 'VERSION' to show TLS 64 byte alignment compatibility.
