EmuELEC CHANGELOG
==================

3.0

Huge update!

New look, new logo (by Prizco), and intro video (by ElF0rma) included! 

Emulationstation now has many new options coming from Batocera-emulationstation and adapted for EmuELEC

Notable features include: 

* Game Settings: You can set some setting that are used on Retroarch directly on this menu, can be set (by priority) per game, per system or globally
* Background music has been upgraded and it now shows the titles, music still goes into /storage/roms/BGM
* Bluetooth controllers! Easy to pair Bluetooth controllers (still need a keybord or other gamepad first)
* Wifi has been revamped, you can still use the old method (By script in setup) or use the on-screen-keyboard to connect to WiFi directly from ES!
* ES Built-in scraper is now working, but Skyscrapper and Selph's scraper are still included
* Themes and Bezels can now be downloaded directly from ES (in menu: system settings, updates)
* Multi language support!
* Many other new features and small changes!


Fixes: 

All platforms:

* OpenBOR: Removed gl4es, it now uses less resources to run
* ResidualVM is now included, put roms in /storage/roms/residualvm, use the included "Scan ResidualVM games" script to populate the list (see note 1)
* ScummVM now includeds a "Scan ScummVM Games" script to populate the list
* Fixed Amiberry sound
* Almost all emulators/cores updated to current versions
* ComicBook theme has a bug that would play multiple videos at the same time so it has been replaced by es-theme-carbon (Fabrice Carusos's version)

Many more small bug fixes and changes, check the git history for those.

2.5 

Initial EmuELEC release

Sx05RE is now EmuELEC, a pure emulation build that does not include Kodi or anything else related to Kodi in order to free resources and space.
The main goal of EmuELEC is to be the best and easiest wat to emulate retro games on Amlogic hardware.

However if you still like to have Kodi on the same installation, you can also use the Kodi Add-on version. But keep in mind it will have less features than EmuELEC
