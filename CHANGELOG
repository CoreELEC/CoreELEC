EmuELEC CHANGELOG
==================

# 4.x (dev)

General:

Fixes: 

* Removed unused scripts, and fixed many small issues with scripts

* Fixed Retroach video recording
* Fixed Eduke not running when having lots or ROMS in ES, by enabling swap (much testing needed!)
* Fixed an issue with ES not playing .ogg music files in BGM
* Fixed some errors messages were not wrapped and could not be read


This version includes a big change on how binaries and scripts are stored, basically to deal with the issue of people not reading how to properly update 
and since I am getting tired of answering the same question over and over again, lets just move all binaries and scripts to RO /usr/bin, this will force 
update all of these and make updating much simpler.

If you use custom scripts /emuelec/bin and /emuelec/lib are still in the path so you will have to deal with it accordingly. 

All configurations regarding emuelec will still be handled in /emuelec/config

Note that this is probably not final, I still need to do a lot of testing, but keep that in mind if you want to update

# 4.0    

Yes its finally here :) 

The change log is HUGE so I am just going to focus on the most important parts (and the ones I can remember):

* EmuELEC is no longer 32bit, it has now moved to AARCH64 (With some small parts still being 32 bit, like PCSX_Rearmed and Parallel64)
* A brand new default theme made specifically for EmuELEC! Crystal! https://github.com/dm2912/Crystal
* For easy access with any computer a third partition (EEROMS) will now be created on the first boot as FAT32, which is where all the ROMS will be stored.
* Update folder is now located in EEROMS/.update in case you want to copy the update files directly, its also still accesible from the samba share
* S912 (Including most Pandora) will no longer be supported, if you have one of those 3.9 is the latest version 
* Most save states are now in one folder (/storage/roms/savestates/[system] or EEROMS/savestates/[system]) I might have missed a few of the standalone emulators, but if you find any issues with that, please let me know, please make sure you move them there if you plan to keep using your old ones
* Introduced ee_defaults.txt https://github.com/EmuELEC/EmuELEC/commit/9358efe01af501326526ce479ca6c5f55932e34a
* Switch all error messages and scripts to use [TvTextViewer](https://github.com/lethal-guitar/TvTextViewer), also improve how these are displayed
* New emulator/cores added Dosbox-pure, Solarus, Tic-80, Mesen, DosBox-Staging, DosBox-X and others
* Dolphin has been added to the Amlogic-ng devices, but it is only really playable on S922x devices and gamepad stills needs to be set manually. Will fix this on v4.1
* Added many ports including Duke Nukem 3D, Sonic 1, 2 and CD, RigelEngine, Bermuda Syndrome, Hydra Castle Labyrinth and others. Keep in mind most of the ports still need the DATA as it is not included! (check `Missing Bios` in the `Game Options`)
* Better Bluetooth manager and connection in general also Keep Bluetooth pairings even if doing a full reset
* Most emulators and cores are updated
* Support for the Odroid-Go Super

As well as many, many other issues, bug fixes and additions I probably forgot! but you can check the (mostly) full change log here: 
https://github.com/EmuELEC/EmuELEC/compare/v3.9...EmuELEC:master

# Very important note!
This version is NOT backwards compatible, meaning this release cannot be used to upgrade older versions! I know lots of people hate reinstalling, but due to the nature of the changes this is a MUST but now with the third partition you can copy the ROMS directly, faster and safer! no messing around with software that corrupts the data! be warned that if you do not do a clean install, you will have issues! 

This version also includes a new auto update script that will hopefully make it easier than ever to update when new versions come out.

If you are new to EmuELEC please READ the WiKi at https://github.com/EmuELEC/EmuELEC/wiki BEFORE asking for any help. You can also join us in discord! https://discord.gg/cbgtJTu If you want to support EmuELEC please click on the "Support" button on top to find out how! 

We have tried our best to test each and every aspect of EmuELEC but keep in mind we cannot test each and every game and setting, so I am sure you will find new and improved bugs and issues! so don't hesitate to jump into discord to let us know, or open an issue right here in GitHub (but please follow the template!) 

# 3.9    

This is the last 32bit release of EmuELEC, this also concludes support for the S912 devices (including Pandora boxes) as there is no 64bit drivers for this SOC. 

Starting from v4.0 EmuELEC will only be 64bits, this unfortunately means that you cannot upgrade from 3.9 to v4.0, so a clean install must be made, but you can do a backup of your roms and settings and copy them over to v4.0 if you like but this has to be done manually. 

This release is mostly bug fixes:

* Emuelec-Emulationstation: Bump to dbb576d
* Retroarch: Fix crash with CHD + Cheevos
* Odroid N2+ :Fix reboot after danger zone reset
* Add Pico-8 Support
* Rename n64.rmp to Mupen64Plus-Next.rmp and Fix remapping loading
* Disable digital to analog on ParaLLEl N64 too
* es-theme-EmuELEC-carbon: Bump to ca062ff
* Fix DOOM location (#308)
* Fix killall triggering crash detection (#303) 
* fix ee_backup 
* OdroidGoAdvance: FIX RGA scaling not covering the whole screen
* Other small changes and fixes. 


# 3.8   

Due to some confusion I removed the v11 from the OdroidGoAdvance name, since the image works on both v1.0 and v1.1, this should not affect functionality at all. 

As a reminder, starting with v4 there will be no more 32bit releases, only ARM64 and upgrading from one to the other is not possible.

# 3.7   

# Important notes

This release has many new features some of them that will require a bit of setting up if you are upgrading. The biggest change  is that the getcores.sh file that was responsible for showing what emulator was used for what platform is no longer used, this means that emuelec.conf and emuoptions.conf from earlier versions will no longer will compatible! (well only the core/emulator part) so if you previously had set some games to run on certain emulators this needs to be redone, sorry about that but its for the better! 

It is highly recommended to do a clean install and just transfer your /storage/roms folder again!
If you are doing this, also make sure your saves are transferred, since there was a bug on v3.6 that used `/storage/.config/retroarch/saves` instead of saving on the same path as the ROM.

**WARNING:** This will REPLACE the es_systems.cfg file, if you manually changed this file those changes will need to be redone, sorry can't seem to find a better way yet.

**WARNING 2:** If your saves are in /storage/.config/retroarch/save* (or any other place other than the /storage/roms folder) make a backup of them BEFORE you update! or they will be lost, RA should now save them on the same folder as the ROM (as it did before) but you need to replace the retroarch.cfg (you can just delete it from network share or ssh and reboot) or change the `savefiles_in_content_dir` and `savestates_in_content_dir` to true in the retroarch.cfg file

If you are updating, remember to run "RESET EMUELEC SCRIPTS AND BINARIES TO DEFAULT" from the EmuELEC meu > Danger Zone after the update is done, otherwise you will run into problems.

Now for the update notes!


# Fixes and new features
* Netplay lobby is now accessible directly from ES for the cores that support it
* Add support for Odroid N2+ (to OC you need to edit config.ini in the first partition `max_freq_a73=2400` and `max_freq_a53=2016`, watch your temps)
* Added (untested) support for LaFrite
* Introduce ee_check_bios: This will check for missing bios before launching a game, and it will display a dialog box if any required bios are missing. Based on #218 by @TheLastProject The only one I did not add to this list is Cgenius as it seems it can be used for several games not just one, so having a requirement for all games seemed bad.
* Add a Bluetooth on/off switch to ES, this will allow you to disable BT if you are not using it.
* setsettings.sh: fix atari800 loading and gambatte colorization
* es_systems.cfg: remove all groups
* Add support to read profile.d from /storage/.config 
* SDL_GameControllerDB: Fix Oga v1.1 mapping
* Emuelec-emulationstation: Change default settings
* advmame: Another attempt at auto config joysticks that should work on the OGA (hopefully)
* fbterm.sh: add "error" to display a dialog box with an error for 10 secs
* emustation-config: make sure the BT agent is not running (this one is important)
* Add sanity checks when launching Cave Story (#218)
* missing-bios: add --filter
* updatecheck.sh: Add forceupdate test
* Added NEC PC-9800 to es_systems.cfg
* Ports: Included hydracastlelabyrinth, OpenTyrian, HodeSDL, Bermuda but only OpenTyrian has a launch script, as soon as I test the others I will add the launch script
* Added a missing core "Quicknes"
* OdroidGoAdvance: Enable 3do and Saturn, I have no idea why people want to play these systems on the OGA, but by popular demand, here they are.
* Fix/improve Bluetooth pairing
* Bluetooth: Try to pair gamepads at boot, to make this work you need to set your game-pad in pairing mode when EmuELEC is booting
* Initial Bluetooth management menu (#209) under setup scripts you will find a new menu driven Bluetooth pairing method, by coach1988, very useful if the regular method does not work for you. 
* YouTube search: Add default search word to ES. under the EmuELEC settings menu there is a new option to set the default word to search, in case you don't have a keyboard this can be used, not ideal, but it works.
* Remove "tiggerhappy", was planing on using it but never got to, so it was just wasting space
* ES can now show PDF manuals from games. 
* set_advmame_joy.sh: force button "a" as "ui_select"

# 3.6
	
	* Fixed AdvanceMame gamepad auto-configuration, a new option to enable/disable this has been set in the Main Menu - EmuELEC Settings.
    * Removed steam controller support, I don't think anyone was using it and it was just eating resources, if many people ask for it I will enable it again.
    * Added small youtube search engine (needs a keyboard) for now its included in the Setup menu script #14.
    * Mplayer: Added support for .twi and .ytb files, if you include a file with a twitch or youtube address it will be played by mplayer (needs internet).
    * Added Skip Song to ES, using the left thumb button (l3) you can skip the current song.
    * Added a small (VERY BETA) way to view videos directly from ES, drop your .mp4, .mkv, mpg, .mov videos to /storage/roms/mplayer and they will appear in ES, it still needs theming, so they will show up withouth an image/icon.
    * Fixed splash screen on 720p resolution or below.
    * Enabled CEC support and Remote support for devices that support it.
    * ES now has some new options to play with including hiding extensions per platform, so if you have .bin/.cue files you can hide one of them and now have no doubles, its available on the "select" menu from a gamelist, under "view customisation" (which has a typo, but thats besides the point).
    * Flycast is now working again, plus added PSP to the no rewind list so it should work even with no rewind enabled globally (it didn't before). 
    * Most emulators have been updated to the latest git.
	* OdroidGoAdvance: Use upstream PPSSPPSDL instead of PPSSPPSDL-GO, there might be gamepad issues.
	* OdroidGoAdvance: Add support for V1.1 with extra buttons and WiFi module, buttons might have changed a bit, taking suggestions on how to best set them up!.
	* OdroidGoAdvance: Besides all the changes mentioned above a sleep mode added by @KiwiHop (many thanks!).
	* OdroidGoAdvance: Fixed a bug that would trigger a black screen on the OGA 10 min after waking up the device.
	* OdroidGoAdvance: Switched global HOTKEY to F5.
	* Synched with CoreELEC 9.2.3.
	* Small script cleanups, other bug fixes and few other tweaks I am forgetting probably.	
	 
	EmuELEC will now force copy es_systems.cfg because when changes were made upstream to es_systems.cfg the update did not copy the new file, this version fixes that.
	WARNING: This will REPLACE the es_systems.cfg file, if you manually changed this file those changes will need to be redone, sorry can't seem to find a better way yet.


# 3.5

* Fixed FPS on Emulationstation would drop after returning from a game (Amlogic-ng)
* Add ee_alsa.always option emuelec.cong use to dissable pulseaudio, this might fix some issues when returning from a game, you will loose mixing sounds in ES

* Danger zone "reset system to default config" will now leave ROMS folders in place
* Introduce maxperf option (enabled by default) useful for OdroidGoAdvance and S912
* Removed core updater from retroarch to keep people from screwing up their installation
* Probably other changes I forgot to mention

New device supported! OdroidGoAdvance

This is the first official release for the OGA, although there are still many know issues, bugs and changes needed I felt it is at a place where I could release
the first official version. 

NOTE: I still expect MANY issues with the OGA release, please bear with me while I keep investigating on known issues and try to fix them

# 3.1

Mostly bug fixes and emulator updates, but there is also a new feature that many have asked for, choosing emulators per game!
Change emulator per system: On the main menu select "GAME SETTINGS" > "ADVANCED" > [Choose system] > "EMULATOR"
Change emulator per game: Navigate to the game you want to choose emu for, press select on the gamepad (Game options menu) choose "ADVANCED GAME OPTIONS" > "EMULATOR"


------------------

# 3.0

Huge update!

Many more small bug fixes and changes, check the git history for those.

Note 1: ResidualVM still has a small bug where the pointer in GUI will not show, so you might need a keyboard to run some games, after the game has started you can use the gamepad withouth an issue.

Initial EmuELEC release

Sx05RE is now EmuELEC, a pure emulation build that does not include Kodi or anything else related to Kodi in order to free resources and space.
The main goal of EmuELEC is to be the best and easiest wat to emulate retro games on Amlogic hardware.

However if you still like to have Kodi on the same installation, you can also use the Kodi Add-on version. But keep in mind it will have less features than EmuELEC
