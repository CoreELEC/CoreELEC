# EmuELEC is now aarch64 ONLY, compiling and using the ARM version (after 3.9) is no longer supported, please check out the master_32bit branch if you wish to build the 32bit version.

# EmuELEC  
Retro emulation for Amlogic devices.  
Based on  [CoreELEC](https://github.com/CoreELEC/CoreELEC) and [Lakka](https://github.com/libretro/Lakka-LibreELEC) with tidbits from [Batocera](https://github.com/batocera-linux/batocera.linux). I just combine them with [Batocera-Emulationstation](https://github.com/batocera-linux/batocera-emulationstation) and some standalone emulators ([Advancemame](https://github.com/amadvance/advancemame), [PPSSPP](https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp), [Reicast](https://github.com/reicast/reicast-emulator), [Amiberry](https://github.com/midwan/amiberry) and others).

**EmuELEC DOES NOT INCLUDE KODI**

Please note, this is mostly a personal project, I can't guarantee that it will work for your box, I've spent many hours trying to optimize and make sure everything works, but I can't test everything and things might just not work at all, also keep in mind the limitations of the hardware and don't expect everything to run at 60FPS (specially N64, PSP and Reicast) I can't guarantee changes to fit your personal needs, but I do appreciate any PRs, help on testing other boxes and fixing issues in general.  
I work on this project on my personal time, I don't make any money out of it, so it takes a while for me to properly test any changes, but I will do my best to help you fix issues you might have on other boxes limited to my time and experience. 

**License**

EmuELEC is based on CoreELEC which in turn is licensed under the GPLv2 (and GPLv2-or-later), all original files created by the EmuELEC team are licensed as GPLv2-or-later and marked as such.

However, the distro includes many non-commercial emulators/libraries/cores/binaries and as such, **it cannot be sold, bundled, offered, included, or anything similar, in any commercial product/application including but not limited to: Android Devices, Smart-TVs, TV-boxes, Hand-held Devices, Computers, SBCs, or anything else that can run EmuELEC.** with those emulators/libraries/cores/binaries included.

I will also add this from the CoreELEC readme, adapted to EmuELEC:

As EmuELEC includes code from many upstream projects it includes many copyright owners. EmuELEC makes NO claim of copyright on any upstream code. Patches to upstream code have the same license as the upstream project, unless specified otherwise. For a complete copyright list please checkout the source code to examine license headers. Unless expressly stated otherwise all code submitted to the EmuELEC project (in any form) is licensed under GPLv2-or-later. You are absolutely free to retain copyright. To retain copyright simply add a copyright header to each submitted code page. If you submit code that is not your own work it is your responsibility to place a header stating the copyright.

**Branding**

All EmuELEC related logos, videos, images and branding in general are the sole property of EmuELEC and they are all Copyrighted by the EmuELEC team and are not to be included in any commercial application whatsoever without the proper authorization, (yes, this includes EmuELEC bundled with ROMS for donations!).

You are however granted permission to include/modify them in your forks/projects as long as they are completely open-source, freely available (as in [but not limited to] not under a bunch of "click this sponsored ad to get the link!"), and do not infringe on any copyright laws, even if you receive donations for such project (we are not against donations for honest people!), we only ask that you give us the proper credit and if possible a link to this repo.

Happy retrogaming!
