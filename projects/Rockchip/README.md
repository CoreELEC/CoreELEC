**My single-board computer is not listed, will it be added in the future?**<br />
If your single-board computer uses a current generation SoC listed on http://opensource.rock-chips.com/wiki_Main_Page the odds are in your favor.

**My Android device is not listed, will it be added in the future?**<br />
You may have luck if your device vendor is open source friendly, otherwise keep using Android for best support.
